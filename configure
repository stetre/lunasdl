# This shell script adds the path to lunasdl.lua to the LUA_PATH 
# environment variable, so that Lua's require() can find it.
# It also adds the path to the examples to LUNASDL_PATH, so that the
# sdl.create() functions can find the examples' agent scripts.
#
# The script must be executed in the LunaSDL base directory, e.g.
# [lunasdl-0.1] $ . configure
#
# To avoid executing it manually in every shell, you may want to copy it
# in your ~/.bash_profile (or ~/.profile or whatever) and change the 
# LUNASDL_BASE variable so to point to where the LunaSDL base directory
# is located on your system.
#
# If you write LunaSDL applications, you may also want to add the path
# to your agents scripts to LUNASDL_PATH in the same way as this script
# does for the examples.
