=== Web pages download

:exampledir: {examplesdir}/webdownload

This example is a LunaSDL version of the Lua coroutines example from chapter 9 of 
Roberto Ierusalimschy's http://www.lua.org/pil/["Programming in Lua"] (a must-read).

The `download.lua` agent script defines an agent that connects to the HTTP port of
an host and downloads a file. The system agent creates four such agents - one for
each desired web page - which _concurrently_ download the files.

As in the PIL example, the files are not saved anywhere and the application just 
counts the downloaded bytes.

The scripts for this example are in `examples/webdownload/`. Run the example
with... well.. you'll figure out.

_(No fancy diagrams here. They would not be very interesting.)_
