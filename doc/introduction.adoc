== Introduction

This manual describes the functions provided by LunaSDL.
It is assumed that the reader is familiar with the
http://www.lua.org[Lua programming language]. Familiarity with SDL may be of help,
but is not essential to read this document.footnote:[

=== What is LunaSDL

LunaSDL is a *Lua module for event-driven concurrent programming*, whose design follows the
concurrency model of the
*http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specification_and_Description_Language[ITU-T Specification and
Description Language (SDL)]*. 

LunaSDL turns Lua into an SDL dialect by extending it with the basic constructs for the
implementation of SDL systems, which are systems composed of concurrent, reactive and
intercommunicating entities referred to as *agents*.footnote:[
LunaSDL is to be considered an _SDL dialect_ in that it slightly deviates from
the http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-Z/en[SDL standards] and has some simplifications:
it uses an all-to-all pid-based communication model, with a single signal queue instead of
per-agent input queues (although one could argue that the per-agent queues ar just merged
but still distinguishable by the destination pid...);
it has no explicit definitions of channels and gates;
in LunaSDL any agent (not only the system agent) may communicate with the environment;
it uses Lua data types and has no built-in support for ADT and ASN.1;
it has additional non-SDL constructs like priority outputs, time-triggered signals and remote
synchronous functions with immediate return.]

What LunaSDL is not. It is not an editor or a validator of SDL specifications, and it is
not a code generator from SDL specifications (it may, however, be used as target language
for tools that do such things). Moreover, LunaSDL is not intended for parallel multithreading
and multi-core programming, nor for hard real-time applications.

=== Getting and installing

The *official repository* of LunaSDL is on GitHub at the following link:
*https://github.com/stetre/lunasdl* .

LunaSDL requires *http://www.lua.org[Lua]* version 5.2 or greater, 
and *https://github.com/diegonehab/luasocket[LuaSocket]*.

Since it is written in plain Lua, no compiling is needed.

LunaSDL has been tested on Linux (Fedora 21) and on OpenBSD (5.6). It may run
on any other OS supported by Lua and LuaSocket, but this has not been tested.

To install LunaSDL, download the 
https://github.com/stetre/lunasdl/releases[latest release] and extract it somewhere
on your system.

To use LunaSDL, make sure that the base directory containing the `lunasdl.lua` script
is in Lua's
http://www.lua.org/manual/5.3/manual.html#pdf-package.path[_package.path_] (for this
purpose, there is an example `configure` shell script in the base directory.)

For example, on a GNU/Linux system, you may do this:

[source,shell]
----
# ... download lunasdl-0.1.tar.gz ...
[ ]$ tar -zxpvf lunasdl-0.1.tar.gz
[ ]$ cd lunasdl-0.1
[lunasdl-0.1]$ . configure
----

Or, using wget:

[source,shell]
----
[ ]$ wget https://github.com/stetre/lunasdl/archive/v0.1.tar.gz
[ ]$ tar -zxpvf v0.1.tar.gz
[ ]$ cd lunasdl-0.1
[lunasdl-0.1]$ . configure
----

Some basic examples can be found in the `examples/` directory and are described
in the <<_examples, Examples>> section of this manual.

Common to all examples, and to LunaSDL applications in general, is the need to properly
set the `LUNASDL_PATH` environment variable so that LunaSDL can find the scripts used by
the application. For more details, see the 
<<_finding_agent_scripts, Finding agent scripts>> section.

=== Module organization

The LunaSDL module is loaded using Lua's 
http://www.lua.org/manual/5.3/manual.html#pdf-require[_require_] function and
returns a table containing the functions it provides 
(as usual with Lua modules). This manual assumes that such
table is named *_sdl_*, i.e. that it is loaded with:

[source,lua,indent=1]
----
sdl = require("lunasdl")
----

but nothing forbids the use of a different name.

As explained later in the manual, LunaSDL creates multiple Lua environments, one per
SDL agent. All these environments share the same *_sdl_* table. In each agent's environment,
LunaSDL defines also some special global variables that it uses to share information
with the agent, and some other special variables for internal use (mostly packed in another
table named *_$$sdl_$$_*). To avoid conflicts with user-defined identifiers, a minimal
naming convention is used. See the <<_special_variables, Special variables>> section
for more details.
