=== Ping Pong

:exampledir: {examplesdir}/pingpong

In this example, the `main.lua` script creates the system agent with the `system.lua` script. 
The system agent then creates two processes with the same agent script, `player.lua`, and
sends a `START` signal to one of them instructing it to start pinging the other, which in
turns pongs in response.
The system agent also sets a timer to control the duration of the ping-pong exchange,
and at the timer expiry it sends a `STOP` signal to both processes and stops itself.

The scripts for this example are in `examples/pingpong/`. Run the example at
the shell prompt with:

[source,shell]
----
[examples/pingpong ]$ lua main.lua
----

(You can also pass the test duration and the ping interval as arguments, in this order).

[source,lua]
----
include::{exampledir}/main.lua[]
----

.System agent
image::{exampledir}/system.png[]

[source,lua]
----
include::{exampledir}/system.lua[]
----

.Player agent
image::{exampledir}/player.png[]

[source,lua]
----
include::{exampledir}/player.lua[]
