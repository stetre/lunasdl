=== Procedure call

:exampledir: {examplesdir}/procedure

This example shows a <<_procedures, procedure call>> and. It also uses
<<_time_triggered_signals, time-triggered signals>>.

The system agent creates a _caller agent_ with the `caller.lua` script and then sends
some signals to it. The caller agent calls the procedure defined in the `procedure.lua`
script. While the procedure is executing, all signals sent to the caller agent by the system agent
are redirected to the procedure, which <<sdl.save, saves>> them.
When the procedure returns, all the signals saved by it are automatically moved in the caller
agent's _saved queue_. The caller <<sdl.restore,restores>> and receives them, and then it
receives other signals newly sent to it by the system agent.

The scripts for this example are in `examples/procedure/`.
