=== Priority signals

:exampledir: {examplesdir}/priority

This example uses priority signals. The main script
<<sdl.prioritylevels, configures the number of priority levels>> to 3
(LunaSDL by default has only 1 level of priority, plus the _no priority_ level),
and then creates the system agent, which sends a few signals with different
priorities to itself. Just to see their order of arrival.

The scripts for this example are in `examples/priority/`.
