== System time

A LunaSDL application has a wallclock that gives the so-called *SDL system time*
(or, shortly, the _system time_). The wallclock is started when the LunaSDL module is first
loaded, so the system time is relative to that point in time, unless the wallclock
is reset during the <<_optional_configurations, configuration phase>>.

'''
[[sdl.now]]
* *sdl.now* ( ) +
-> _timestamp_ +
 +
Returns the current system time, in seconds.

'''
[[sdl.since]]
* *sdl.since* ( _timestamp_ ) +
-> _timedifference_ +
 +
Returns the time elapsed from the point in time given by _timestamp_.

'''
[[sdl.startingtime]]
* *sdl.startingtime* ( )  +
-> _startingtime_ +
 +
Returns the absolute timestamp corresponding to the point _0 (zero)_ of the system time.
The meaning of this timestamp depends on the underlying function used to retrieve
time from the operating system (see <<sdl.setwallclock, _sdl.setwallclock_ >> for more
details).
