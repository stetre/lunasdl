=== Ping Pong over UDP

:exampledir: {examplesdir}/udppingpong

This example reuses the `player.lua` script from the <<_ping_pong, Ping Pong>> example.

This time the two player agents exchanging pings and pongs are created in two different
systems - i.e. two different OS processes - and communicate over UDP. The system agent
of each side translates messages received on the socket into signals to be forwarded to
the local player agent, and viceversa.

The scripts for this example are in `examples/udppingpong/`. To run the example
there are two shell scripts, `responder` and `initiator`, to be executed in this order
in two different shells.

Please notice how the shell scripts define the `LUNASDL_PATH` environment variable so that
LunaSDL can find the `player.lua` script in the directory containing the previous example
(this is needed in this example because the script is not in the current directory).
